\section{Greedy}
\begin{Exercise}
Given an array $A$ of $n$ integers, design an algorithm to construct an array $B$ of $n$ integers minimizing $\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} B[i]$ subject to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $B[i] > 0$ for all $0 \leq i < n$.
\item $B[i] > B[i + 1]$ if $A[i] > A[i + 1]$ for all $0 \leq i < n - 1$.
\item $B[i] < B[i + 1]$ if $A[i] < A[i + 1]$ for all $0 \leq i < n - 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}
This problem can be considered as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem}{constraint satisfaction problem} in which all $B[i]$'s are variables, and corresponding constraints can be modeled.
Since the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_graph}{constraint graph} is a path, the problem can be solved in linear time by enforcing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_consistency#Directional_consistency_and_satisfiability}{directional consistency} first and then assign values.

For each $i$, let $D_i$ be the domain of $B[i]$.
The algorithm is as follows:
initially, $D[i]$ is the set of all positive integers for all $0 \leq i < n$.
Then, process $A[i]$ for $i = 0$ to $i = n - 1$ in order.
If $A[i] < A[i + 1]$, then the domain of $B[i+1]$ is changed to the set of all positive integers that are larger than $\min D_i$.
After all $A[i]$ are processed, all domains are directional consistent in the constraint graph.
Finally, assign all $B[i]$ from $i = n - 1$ to $0$ to the smallest integer in $D_i$ that are consistent with the previous variables.

\begin{Exercise}[title=Gasoline puzzle]
There are $n$ gas station around a circle and station $i$ has a finite amount of gas $g[i]$. 
You can only drive car in increasing order of $i$ and wrapping around in the $n$-th station. 
The fuel consumption from the station $i$ to the station $(i + 1) \text{ mod } n$ is $c[i]$. 
Design an algorithm to find a feasible stating location so that you can finish a round trip.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}
Let $x[i] = g[i] - c[i]$. If the summation of $x[i]$ is less than zero, then round-trip is impossible. 
Let $P[i]$ be the summation of $x[0\dots i]$. 
Than pick the index $i$ that minimizes $P[i-1]$ as the starting point. 
For any station $j > i$, the amount of gas that we will have at station $j$ is $P[j-1] - P[i-1]$, which is never negative. 
Similarly, it is feasible to arrive all stations $j < i$ and back to $i$.
\begin{remark}
The solution can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problem~\cite{Berger2011}. This problem appears on \href{https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/}{LeetCode}.
