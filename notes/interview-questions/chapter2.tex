\chapter{Problems on strings}
A string is a sequence of characters.
\paragraph{Notation}
For a string $S$ of length $n$, $S[0], \dots, S[n - 1]$ denotes $S$'s characters in order, and $S[i \dots j]$ denotes the substring starting at $i$ ending at $j$.
For two strings $S$ and $T$, $S + T$ denotes the concatenation of $S$ and $T$.

\section{Determine properties}
In this section, we focus on the problems of determining properties of a given string.

\begin{Exercise}[title=Cyclic equality]
Two strings $S$ and $T$ are \emph{cyclic-equivalent} if $S$ can be transformed into $T$ by shift circularly.
That is, for some index $i$, $S[i\dots n - 1] + S[0 \dots i - 1]$ equals $T$.
Given two strings $S$ and $T$ of the same length $n$, design an algorithm to determine whether $S$ and $T$ are cyclic-equivalent.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
For a string $A$, we use $A^i$ to denote the string of rotating $A$ to the left by $i$ positions circularly; that is $A^i = A[i \dots n - 1] + A[0 \dots i - 1]$.
The \emph{lexicographically minimal string} of a string $A$ is $\min_i A^i$ with respect to the lexicographical order.

Let $S^*$ and $T^*$ be the lexicographically minimal strings of $S$ and $T$ respectively.
The algorithm is based on the following observation:
strings $S$ and $T$ are cyclic-equivalent if and only if $S^* = T^*$.

Let $D_S$ be the set of indices $i$ that $S^i$ is larger than $T^j$ for some $j$; that is, $D_S = \{ i \mid \exists_j T^j < S^i \}$.
Similarly, $D_T$ can be defined.
Note that $S$ and $T$ are not cyclic-equivalent, if and only if both $D_S$ or $D_T$ contains $\{0, \dots, n - 1\}$.
The idea is to compute $D_S$ and $D_T$ incrementally and test whether $D_S$ or $D_T$ contains $\{0, \dots, n - 1\}$.

The computation of $D_S$ is based on the following fact: if $S[i + l] = T[j + l]$ for all $0 \leq l < k $ and $S[i + k] < T[i + k]$ for some $k$, then $S^{i + l} < T^{i + l}$ for all $0 \leq l \leq k$.
Thus, for a give pair of indices $(i, j)$, the algorithm finds the largest $k$ such that $S[i + l] = T[j + l]$ for all $0 \leq l < k $ and $T[i + k] < S[i + k]$, then $D_S$ must contain $\{ i \dots i + k\}$.
Repeatedly apply this rule to compute both $D_S$ and $D_T$.

\subparagraph{Complexity analysis} The time complexity is $O(n)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

This solution is from Shiloach's paper~\cite{Shiloach1979}.\footnote{\url{http://stackoverflow.com/a/31001317/1260984}.}
Another approach is to find the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographically_minimal_string_rotation}{lexicographically minimal string rotation} directly.
Since lexicographically minimal string rotation can be found in linear time using $O(1)$ space, this problem can be solved in linear time using $O(1)$ space.

\section{Approximate string matching}
\begin{Exercise}[title=Wildcard matching]
Let \verb+`.'+ be a wildcard character that can match any single character and \verb+`*'+ be a wildcard character that can match any sequence of characters.
Given a string $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$ in which $P$ may contain wildcard characters, design an algorithm to determine whether $P$ matches $T$.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}
Since the wildcard \verb+`*'+ can match any sequence of characters, our idea is to partition the pattern into several sub-patterns separated by \verb+`*'+, and match each sub-pattern independently.

Without loss of generality, we assume that $P[0]$ and $P[m - 1]$ are \verb+`*'+'s.
Suppose that $P$ contains $k + 1$ \verb+`*'+'s. 
The string $P$ can be partitioned into $k$ sub-patterns, $S_1, \dots, S_{k}$, and $k - 1$ \verb'*''s such that $P = \text{\texttt{*}}  + S_1 + \text{\texttt{*}} + \dots + \text{\texttt{*}} + S_{k} + \text{\texttt{*}}$, and each sub-pattern $S_i$ has no \verb+`*'+ wildcard.

Consider the first two sub-patterns $S_1$ and $S_2$.
Let $i_1$ be the smallest index that $T[i_1 \dots i_1 + \abs{S_1} - 1]$ matches $S_1$.
Since match $S_1$ and $S_2$ should be matched in order, $S_2$ can only be matched to a substring starting after $i_1 + \abs{S_1} - 1$.
Moreover, since a \verb+`*'+ wildcard appears between $S_2$ and $S_3$, it suffices to find the smallest $i_2 \geq i_1 + \abs{S}$ that $T[i_2 \dots i_2 + \abs{S_2} - 1]$ matches $S_2$.
Let $i_j$ be the smallest index at least $i_{j-1} + \abs{S_{j-1}}$ that $T[i_j \dots i_j + \abs{S_j} - 1]$ matches $S_j$.
If all $i_j$'s are well-defines, then we found a match.
Thus, the crucial part of this problem is as follows: given a pattern $S$ without a \verb+`*'+ wildcard, find the first match of $S$ in $T$.

Let $S$ be a pattern without a \verb+`*'+ wildcard. 
Suppose that all characters in the alphabet are represented by positive integers, and the wildcard \verb+`.'+ is represented by zero. 
Then, for each start position $i$ in $T$, the expression $\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} S[j] T[i + j] (S[j] - T[i + j])^2$ is zero if and only if $S$ matches $T[i \dots \abs{S}]$. 
The expressions for all start positions can be evaluated in $O(n \lg n)$ time by using the fast Fourier transform.

In order to reduce the time complexity to $O(n \lg \abs{S})$, we create $h = \frac{n}{\abs{S}}$ overlapping substrings of $T$, $T_1, \dots, T_h$, where $\abs{T_a} = 2m$ for all $1 \leq a \leq h$, $T_1$ is a prefix of $T$, and the first $m$ characters of $T_a$ is the same as the last $m$ characters of $T_{a - 1}$ for all $1 < a \leq h$.
We evaluate the expressions in the order of $T_1, \dots, T_h$ and the time complexity is $O(n \lg \abs{S})$.
Moreover, the index $i$ of the first match can be computed in $O((i + \abs{S}) \lg \abs{S})$.

\subparagraph{Complexity analysis} The time complexity is $O(n \lg \abs{S})$.
