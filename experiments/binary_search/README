This is a comparison between a standard binary search and a biased binary search
that instead of picking mid = low + (high - low) / 2, pick mid = low + (high - low) / 4.

For integer arrays, biased binary search is slightly more efficient than standard binary search.
This may be due to the misprediction penalty in standard binary search.
However, if the comparison between elements is expensive, then comparison will dominate the time cost.
Or, if the size of element is larger, than cache miss penalty will dominate the time cost.
Thus, biased binary search may only be useful in some limited scenarios.
