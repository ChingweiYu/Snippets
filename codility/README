My solution for Codility programming challenges.
All solutions receives perfect score and satisy the complexity requirement.

For some problems, it is not necessary to satisfy the complexity requirement
to obtain perfect score.

Beta 2010: Don't need to reduce the space complexity to linear.
Theta 2011: Don't need to precompute lower and farthest to get linear time.
